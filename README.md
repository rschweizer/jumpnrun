# Jump'n'Run

> Just a simple Jump'n'Run game built with Phaser.

## Demo
For a live demo visit https://rschweizer.github.com/jumpnrun

## Usage
You need a simple file server to run this game locally. You can install *http-server* via npm for this.

```
$ cd ./path/to/repository/jumpnrun
$ npm install -g http-server
...
$ http-server
```

Just run *http-server* from within your repository and go to the outputted url – should be http://localhost:8080. Then simply click on the *dist/* folder and voilà.

**Or simply visit the live demo online as described above ;)**
